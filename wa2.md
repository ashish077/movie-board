## Question 4
(4 pts)

- [ ] The answer demonstrates an understanding of the fact that the asymptotic complexities differ by only a constant factor. (2 pt)
- [ ] The answer calls out the first-name array approach as faster by a constant factor. (2 pt)

## Question 5
(3 pts)

Any of the following are valid reasons (if justified) for full credit (4 pt):
- [ ] The answer demonstrates an understanding of the fact that there may be a linear scan over the array to find the hint if there is not a name with a specific first letter.
- [ ] The answer says no overhead.

## Question 6
(6 pts)

- [ ] The answer demonstrates an understanding of the fact that the distribution of first-name first-letters is non-uniform in practice. (6 pt)
    * Alternative, acceptable answer: "Molly", etc... have alphabetically later 2nd letters than "Xavier"
